# CVE-Database-API

The CVE Database API is a Flask-based web service that allows users to interact with a database containing information about Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). This API provides endpoints for retrieving details of specific CVEs, fetching all CVE data, adding new CVE records, updating existing records, and deleting CVEs from the database.

### 1. Installation and Setup
To run the CVE Database API locally, follow these steps:

##### 2. Clone the Repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
https://github.com/Yakuta110/CVE-Database-API.git
```
##### 3. Install Dependencies: 
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:

```
cd CVE-Database-API

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### 4. Set Up the Database:
Ensure you have SQLite installed on your system. The SQLite database file (**database.db**) is included in the repository. If you need to create a new database, you can modify the connection string in `flaskCveApi.py` to point to your desired SQLite database file.

##### 5. Run the Application: 
Execute the Flask application by running the following command:
```
flaskCveApi.py
```
##### 6. Access the API: 
Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or by making HTTP requests using curl or Python's requests library.
